# Eclipse

This project powers the ARC heater controller for use with the Polyarc&reg;.

## Development

The Eclipse is driven by an Arduino board and can be developed in the same way as any other Arduino-based project. The USB interface on the back of the box goes directly into the board. You can use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software) to both write code and push updates to the board. Other IDEs work fine as well with additional setup steps but this is probably the most simple, effective method for development.

## Deployment

See [EclipsePatch](https://github.com/activated-research-company/EclipsePatch) for information on how to puslish software releases both on the ARC website and to individual customers.
